description: Generate SoloMkt-KV marketing KV poster images through natural-language OpenCode/Codex guidance. Use when the user asks to configure or validate a SoloMkt-KV API key, list or choose KV models, create activity or event key visual images, or call the SoloMkt-KV models and generateKV APIs.

# Generator-KV

Use this skill as a conversational workflow. Resolve the plugin root as two directories above this `SKILL.md`; the helper script is `scripts/solomkt_kv.py`.

## Credential Setup

Credentials live in `$SoloMkt-KV_HOME/.credentials.json`.

The helper also accepts `SOLOMKT_KV_HOME` because hyphenated environment variable names are hard to set in many shells. If neither variable is set, credentials default to `~/.solomkt-kv/.credentials.json`.

Never print the user's API key after it is provided.

When the user asks to configure the plugin, or when any workflow fails because credentials are missing:

1. Run `python <plugin-root>/scripts/solomkt_kv.py credentials-path` and tell the user where the key will be stored.
2. Ask the user to provide the SoloMkt-KV API key if they have not already provided it.
3. Save and validate it with `python <plugin-root>/scripts/solomkt_kv.py configure --api-key "<key>" --validate`.
4. If validation succeeds, tell the user setup is complete and explain that they can now ask naturally for KV generation.
5. If validation fails, report the sanitized error and ask the user to confirm the key or network access.

## Generation Workflow

Every generation request must fetch the current model list first.

1. Check credentials with `python <plugin-root>/scripts/solomkt_kv.py check-credentials --validate`.
2. Fetch models with `python <plugin-root>/scripts/solomkt_kv.py models`.
3. Present available models by index, name, id, sub-style, tags, and preview URL when available. Ask the user to choose one model unless they already selected a model from the freshly fetched list.
4. Collect required fields before generation:
   - `activityName`: 1-200 characters
   - `activityTheme`: 1-200 characters
   - `activityTime`: 1-200 characters
   - `activityLocation`: 1-200 characters
5. Optionally collect:
   - `prompt`: up to 1000 characters
   - `posterQuality`: defaults to `2K`
   - `posterSize`: defaults to `["16:9"]` and must be passed as a string
6. Before calling generation, tell the user generation can take several minutes and the timeout is 10 minutes. The helper re-fetches models and rejects a stale or unknown `modelId` before posting to `generateKV`.
7. Call:

```bash
python <plugin-root>/scripts/solomkt_kv.py generate \
  --model-id "<modelId>" \
  --activity-name "<activityName>" \
  --activity-theme "<activityTheme>" \
  --activity-time "<activityTime>" \
  --activity-location "<activityLocation>" \
  --prompt "<prompt>" \
  --poster-quality "2K" \
  --poster-size "[\"16:9\"]" \
  --timeout 600
```

8. Return the generated image URLs to the user. If image URLs are returned, render them with Markdown image syntax when useful.
